### About Me:
My acquaintance with the field of teaching and programming began with admission to the specialty "the educator of computer science and English" at BSU. Even then I understood, that the computer technologies are our future, although back then in 2000 they were just beginning to develop in our country.

After graduating from the university, I was engaged in various activities, one way or another related to my major. At 2011, I became interested in creating websites and then made her first own website.
Then I went into teaching, this is my main major, and taught maths, and later robotics.

And I began to teach programming when I got a job as a programming teacher for children, which I still do. 
What I have been studying at the present time, independently and in courses. As a teacher myself, I know and understand, how important it is to constantly develop and acquire new knowledge, especially their application in practice.

I believe that my dedication, love for teaching and knowledg will help many children become a great Frontend developer. 

Thank you all for your attention.
